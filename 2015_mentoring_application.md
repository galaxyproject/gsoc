1. Describe your organization.

  The Galaxy Project is not a formal or legal organization - it is a community
  of those who work on Galaxy - an open, web-based platform for data intensive
  biomedical research. Galaxy is a successful open source project with direct
  contributions to the core project from dozens of developers - and many more
  developers than that building plugins (to integrate bioinformatics
  applications), building downstream projects leveraging Galaxy via its API,
  and maintaining forks that tailor Galaxy to specific sites or scientific
  application areas. Galaxy is actively deployed and extended at dozens if not
  hundreds of sites ranging from small academic labs to large public research
  institutions and private corporations. Our mentor list is made up developers
  and researchers from many different Universities and spanning three
  continents.

1. Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code
   2015? What do you hope to gain by participating?

  The Galaxy Project is passionate about open source and education in
  bioinformatics - we feel the Google Summer of Code will be a great
  opportunity to advance these objectives. Our project idea list also features
  numerous cross-project integration ideas - we hope to grow not only our own
  developer community but also the communities of other projects while
  simultaneously strenghening relationships between these projects. The core
  Galaxy project is largely funded by an National Institute of Health grant
  whose mandate is that of supporting biotechnology resources - supporting and
  growing communities is literally what we are paid to do.

  The Galaxy Project - given its scope - will provide a great opportunity for
  students to gain exposure to many different and cutting edge aspects of
  bioinformatics and computing more broadly. Galaxy supports many different
  scientific application areas - such as genomics, protemics, and
  cheminformatics - while simultaneously building on many aspects of modern
  informatics - such as data science, scientific workflow management,
  usability, and a variety of computing types (cloud, container, and
  traditional cluster). We believe this diversity is reflected in our project
  idea list and are confident it means Galaxy will provide an abundance of
  opportunities to potential students. Put another way - we have a wide variety
  of projects each of which can be taken in diverse directions and we are
  confident this will provide an excellent learning experience for students
  with divergent interests.


1. Has your organization participated in past Google Summer of Codes? (yes/no)

  No - at least as its own mentoring organization, but Galaxy developers have
  successfully mentored a student project related to Galaxy as part of the
  Genome Informatics organization in the past.

1. If you answered “yes” to the question above, please summarize your
   involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation. Please
   also list your pass/fail rate for each year.

  N/A as an organization.  All of the students that developers have helped
  mentor under other organizations passed.

1. If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of
   Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

   No.

1. What Open Source Initiative approved license(s) does your project use?

   Galaxy is licensed under the Academic Free License version 3.0 - an OSI
   approved license.

1. What is the URL for your Ideas list? This is the most important part of your
   proposal. Please make sure we can access it and it is complete when you
   submit this proposal. “Placeholder” or inaccessible ideas pages will be
   grounds for an automatic rejection for participation in Google Summer of
   Code 2015.

1. What is the main development mailing list for your organization?

  The main development mailing list is galaxy-dev@lists.galaxyproject.org and
  an online archive is available at http://dev.list.galaxyproject.org/.

1. What is the main IRC channel for your organization?

  `#galaxyproject` on freenode.

1. Who will be your backup organization administrator?

  Dannon Baker - dannon.baker@gmail.com.

1. What criteria did you use to select the mentors? Please be as specific as
   possible.

  We have selected projects that we believe will have a high impact on making
  biomedical research more open and accessible - and then within that framework
  worked to find mentors who we believe will enable and guide students to be
  successful. We have chosen people who are friendly and eager to mentor and
  who care about the given project. While we have a diverse group of potential
  mentors - we are certain each is dedicated and has a track record of
  successful contributions to open source and is well known in the Galaxy
  community and to the organizers.

1. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as
   specific as possible.

  The organizers intend to check in with each student on a weekly basis in
  order to uncover blocking issues and then address issues in a timely fashion
  or help find alternatives to work around these blocks. We will encourage
  mentors to communicate with even greater frequency. For internally initiated
  communication, the organizers will be available daily on IRC and will respond
  quickly to e-mails from students - and we have selected mentors that we
  believe will be likewise timely in responses as well as welcoming. We hope
  that intervening before problems grow too overwhelming to students will help
  prevent disappearing students.

  That said - the nature of student projects is sometimes they disappear. If
  after several failures to communicate with students or if issues arise that
  neither mentor nor organizers can address - we will solicit advice from the
  Google Summer of Code community (if appropriate) and then contact the
  organizers at Google and explain the nature of the problem.

1. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? Please be as
   specific as possible.

  Given the current list of mentors and projects, we are confident the
  probability of disappearing mentors is minimal - these are dedicated
  professionals who believe in the value of mentoring students and fostering
  open source communities and the projects listed. That said each project in
  the idea list has multiple potential mentors and we are confident any of them
  could step in and ensure the continuity of these projects. In the unlikely
  event that both potential mentors do not work out - the Galaxy core
  development team has numerous full time developers who are paid to work on
  the project and who the organizers are confident could fill in as mentors for
  these projects. In particular the organizers will certainly be available to
  fill in this role.

1. What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your
   project's community before, during and after the program?

  Galaxy has detailed documentation walking new developers through the
  ecosystem at https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/Develop/GettingStarted. This
  covers using Galaxy, writing plugins (tools), contributing to the core
  project (including linking out to a list of open bugs and enhancements that
  are excellent places to get started at https://trello.com/c/eFdPIdIB), and an
  overview of related projects with links to relevant documentation and issue
  pages. Before the projects get underway we will encourage potential students
  to walk through this documentation and start to make contributions, bringing
  them into the developer community. We will also encourage early communication
  both on IRC and with our development mailing list.

  We have already laid out our plan to frequently touch base with students
  during the project itself. In addition to these e-mails, we will encourage
  students to commit frequently and keep track of their progress on our Trello
  board - we are confident this will lead to conversations with the wider
  community. The ideas laid out in the project ideas list include multiple
  milestones that should facilitate this iterative development style and lead
  to these to these more frequent, smaller commits that can discussed by the
  community.

  Finally, we believe all the projects listed are open ended and exciting
  enough that we will have a good chance of motivating students to continue
  with the projects once the summer is over. The projects are also very
  impactful and so the wider Galaxy development community will continue to be
  interested in ongoing efforts - this we hope will nurture ongoing
  communication.

1. Are you a new organization who has a Googler or other organization to vouch
   for you? If so, please list their name(s) here.

  Nicole Deflaux (Google Genomics)
  Jonathan Bingham (Google Genomics)
  Amy Unruh (Google Cloud Platform)
  Warwick Irwin (Googler)

1. Are you an established or larger organization who would like to vouch for a
   new organization applying this year? If so, please list their name(s) here.

  Though neither is new - we have collaborated with both the Genome Informatics
  and BioJS organizations this year and are confident that both would be
  fantastic mentoring organizations for the Google Summer of Code.

1. What will you do to encourage that your accepted students stick with the
   project after Google Summer of Code concludes?

  We believe that the proposed projects are technically exciting and are
  confident that will help. In addition to the required blog post describing
  the summer's projects, we will provide positive feedback to students by
  highlighting their accomplishments in our release notes and on our Twitter
  feed. So beyond just technical aspects, we believe providing credit and
  positive feedback will help encourage ongoing engagement with the project.

  We suspect Galaxy will attract students interested in bioinformatics and
  graduate school - such students may be interested in writing academic papers
  about their projects. If this is the case, we believe this will provide an
  incentive to continue to interact with the community after the summer is
  complete and we will happily assist with these papers and provide ongoing
  feedback. Hundreds of papers are written every year involving Galaxy in some
  way
  (https://wiki.galaxyproject.org/GalaxyProject/Statistics#Publications_.2F_Citations)
  and last year's intern Saket Choudhary has a preprint up on bioRxiv.org
  describing some of his contributions to the Galaxy -
