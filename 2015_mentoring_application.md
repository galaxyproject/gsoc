1. Describe your organization.

  The Galaxy Project is not a formal or legal organization - it is a community
  of those who work on Galaxy - an open, web-based platform for data intensive
  biomedical research. Galaxy is a successful open source project with direct
  contributions to the core project from dozens of developers - and many more
  developers than that building plugins such as Galaxy tools to integrate
  bioinformatics applications and downstream projects leveraging Galaxy (for
  instance through its API), and various forks tailored to specific sites or
  application areas. Galaxy is actively deployed and extended at dozens if not
  hundreds of sites ranging from small acedemic labs to large public research
  institutions and private corporations.

1. Why is your organization applying to participate in Google Summer of Code 2015? What do you hope to gain by participating?

  The Galaxy Project is passionate about open source and education in
  bioinformatics - we feel the Google Summer of Code will be a great opportunity
  to advance these objectives. Our project idea list also features integration
  aspects - we hope to grow not only our own developer community but
  also other open source communities and foster relationships between projects.

  Given the scope of the Galaxy Project - we believe as a mentoring organization
  will provide a great opportunity for students to gain exposure to many
  different cutting edge aspects of bioinformatics and computing more broadly.
  Galaxy supports many different application areas - such
  as genomics, protemics, and cheminformatics - while simultaneously building on
  many aspects of modern informatics - such as scientific workflow management,
  usability, data science, and a variety of computing platfoms (cloud,
  container, and traditional cluster). We believe this diversity is reflected in
  our project idea list and hopefully means we will provide an abundance of
  opportunities to potential students. Put another way - we have a wide variety
  of projects each of which can be taken in diverse directions and we are
  confident this will provide an excellent learning experience for students with
  many different interests.


1. Has your organization participated in past Google Summer of Codes? (yes/no)

  No - at least as its own mentoring organization, but Galaxy developers have
  successfully mentored student projects related to Galaxy as part of the Genome
  Informatics organization in the past.

1. If you answered “yes” to the question above, please summarize your involvement and the successes and challenges of your participation. Please also list your pass/fail rate for each year.

  TODO

1. If your organization has not previously participated in Google Summer of Code, have you applied in the past? If so, for what year(s)?

   No.

1. What Open Source Initiative approved license(s) does your project use?

   Galaxy is licensed under the Acemedic Free License version 3.0 - an OSI approved license. https://bitbucket.org/galaxy/galaxy-central/src/tip/LICENSE.txt

1. What is the URL for your Ideas list? This is the most important part of your proposal. Please make sure we can access it and it is complete when you submit this proposal. “Placeholder” or inaccessible ideas pages will be grounds for an automatic rejection for participation in Google Summer of Code 2015.

  TODO provide backup PDF

1. What is the main development mailing list for your organization?

  The main development mailing list is galaxy-dev@lists.galaxyproject.org and
  an online archive is available at http://dev.list.galaxyproject.org/.

1. What is the main IRC channel for your organization?

  #galaxyproject on freenode.

1. Who will be your backup organization administrator?

  Dannon Baker - dannon.baker@gmail.com.

1. What criteria did you use to select the mentors? Please be as specific as possible.

  We have selected projects that we believe will have a high impact on making
  biomedical research more open and accessible - and then within that framework
  picked mentors who we believe will enable and guide students to do their best.

1. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing students? Please be as specific as possible.

  The organizers intend to check in with each student on a weekly basis in order to uncover blocking issues and then address issues in a timely fashion or help find alternatives to work around these blocks. We will encourage mentors to communicate with even greater frequency. For intern intiated communication, the organizers will be available daily on IRC and will respond quickly to e-mails from students - and we have mentors that we believe will be likewise timely in responses as well have friendly. We hope that intervening before problems grow.

  That said - the nature of student projects is sometimes they disappear. If after several failures to communicate with students or if issues arise that neither mentor nor organizers can address - we will solicit advice from the Google Summer of Code community (if appropriate) and then contact the organizers at Google and explain the nature of the problem.

1. What is your plan for dealing with disappearing mentors? Please be as specific as possible.

  Given the current list of mentors and projects, we are confident the probablity of disappearing mentors is minimal - these are dedicated professionals who believe in the value of mentoring students and fostering open source communities. That said each project in the idea list has multiple potential mentors and we are confident any of them could step in and ensure the continuity of these projects. In the unlikely event that both potential mentors do not work out - the Galaxy core development has numerous full time developers who are paid to work on the project and who we are confident could fill in as mentors for these projects - in particular the organizers will certainly be available to fill in this role.

1. What steps will you take to encourage students to interact with your project's community before, during and after the program?

  Galaxy has 

1. Are you a new organization who has a Googler or other organization to vouch for you? If so, please list their name(s) here.

  TODO

1. Are you an established or larger organization who would like to vouch for a new organization applying this year? If so, please list their name(s) here.

  Though neither is new - we have collaborated with both the Genome Informatics and BioJS organizations this year and are confident that both would be fantastic organizations for the Google Summer of Code.

1. What will you do to encourage that your accepted students stick with the project after Google Summer of Code concludes?

  In addition to the required blog post describing the summer's projects - we
  will provide positive feedback by highlighting the accomplishments in our
  release notes and on the Twitter feed.

  We suspect Galaxy will attract students interested in bioinformatics and
  graduate school - such students may be interested in writing acedemic papers
  about their contributions. If this is the case, we believe this will provide
  an incentive to continue to interact with the community after the summer is
  complete and we will happily assist with these and provide ongoing feedback.
